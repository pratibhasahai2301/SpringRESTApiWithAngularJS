# SpringRESTApiWithAngularJS
This project is basically divided into two parts:

CompanyDetailsService
---------------------

CompanyDetailsService is a REST web service developed using Java Spring MVC framework. This service supports:

* Create new company
* Get a list of all companies
* Get details about a company

A Company has the following attributes:
* Company ID

* One or more beneficial owner(s)

The service contains following rest methods:

| Rest Method         | HTTPVerb | Path Variable  | Data                   |

| get_all_companies   | GET      |None            |None                    |

| add_beneficial_owner| POST     |companyId       |List of BeneficialOwner |

CompanyDetailsClient
--------------------

CompanyDetailsClient is a AngularJS project that serves as a client for ClientDetailsService that uses gulp as a build tool.
|I have used sass and bootstrap for css.

Testing webservice with cURL:
-----------------------------

* *Create a company*:

    curl -v -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/CompanyDetailsService/create_company -d "{\"companyName\":\"My Company\",\"address\":\"GGn\",\"city\":\"GGN\",\"country\":\"IND\",\"email\":\"test@test.com\",\"phone\":\"1234567890\"}"

* *Get company By Id*:

    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/CompanyDetailsService/get_company_by_id/1

Considerations
--------------
**Authentication Protocol/Method**

**Making the service redundant**
